		<h4>Description of the tools</h4>
			<p>
				We are using Visual Studio Code as Integerated Developement Environment along with Intellij for development.
				The autocompelete and intellisense features help in writing javascript and html code in these IDE'S.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are using Leaflet API for drawing maps and pin's on map for showing the crime data. It is really simple tool that let us plot and draw maps
				using simple javascript API. It is simple and easy to maintain
			</p>
			<p>
				We are using Nominatim API to get the coordintes for locations from crime data so that we can plot them. Currently they have limitation's on their call
				If you make too many request it blocks you.
